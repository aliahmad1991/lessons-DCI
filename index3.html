             <h1> I'M A GREAT TRAVELER </h1>
             <p>
            Ibn Battuta, or ‘Abu Abd al-Lah Muhammad ibn Abd al-Lah l-Lawati t-Tangi ibn Batutah’
             to give him his full name, is a strong contestant for the greatest traveller in history. 
             Not only did he travel a distance greater than the diameter of the Earth, he did most of it 
             overland, travelling in caravans at a time when boat was both the much faster and safer option. 
             He travelled from Morocco, his home, as far as Kilwa in modern Tanzania, China, and Mali, as well
              as visiting Mecca, Dehli, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Granada, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Samarkand,
               among hundreds of other places. He attended the courts of two different Emperors, Roman and Chinese, 
               and visited the home city of the wealthiest man who had ever lived, Mansa Musa of Mali.
